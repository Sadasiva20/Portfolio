Introduction
This portfolio demonstrates my proficiency in both front-end and back-end development.

On the front-end, I use React to build dynamic user interfaces, creating responsive, interactive web applications. I leverage Tailwind CSS for utility-first, highly customizable designs, ensuring fast development and a polished user experience.

For the back-end, I utilize Node.js to build scalable server-side applications, focusing on performance and maintainability. I also work with Next.js, a modern full-stack framework, to seamlessly handle both client-side and server-side operations for a more efficient and optimized web experience.

This portfolio showcases my ability to develop full-stack applications with an emphasis on clean, maintainable, and efficient code that provides exceptional user experiences across multiple devices.
